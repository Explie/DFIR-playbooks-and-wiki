id="description-">Description <a name="desc"></a><a class="hash-link" href="#description-" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Ransomware attacks can be characterized by infecting large segments of an existing network and encrypting data on server and client systems without the possibility for the legitimate users to get access to this data. The decryption key/mechanism will then be presented to the legitimate user by the attacker in exchange for a more or less reasonable amount of money, most likely in the form of digital currency like bitcoin. The attacker will leave information on the encrypted system on how to contact them for payment and retrieving the decryption methods.<br>
<!-- -->Ransomware became one of the most lucrative cyberattacks in the recent years and is often spread with phishing campaigns against end users or by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in external facing systems. Most times the attackers have had deep system access for a long time before the actual encryption of data.<br>
<!-- -->In the event of a ransomware-attack fast response is critical since this could stop ongoing encryption and lateral movement. Most times a hard organization-wide shutdown can&#x27;t be avoided, but the recovery time can highly depend upon the maturity of the incident response program of the organization.Â <br>
<!-- -->Ransomware events are most likely only the end of an ongoing infiltration of a network. In many cases the attackers will already mapped your network and gathered credentials long before. Even the extortion of data over a long time span is not uncommon nowadays.<br>
<!-- -->Ransomware in particular is still mostly focused on Windows based systems and domains. The recommendations in this playbook aim to be universal but may sometimes be specific to Windows systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safeguards-">Safeguards <a name="safe"></a><a class="hash-link" href="#safeguards-" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>These Safeguards are designed to limit the spread and/or impact of a potential ransomware infection. Since ransomware infections often come with wide-spread network compromise the safeguards are also focused on this part.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mature-patch-management">Mature Patch Management<a class="hash-link" href="#mature-patch-management" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>When preparing for cyberattacks in general it is highly advised to implement available patches in a safe and fast manner. This way known vulnerabilities can be tackled and the exploitation of these can be stopped.<br>
<!-- -->It is important to keep in mind that not only all available components including network components (routers, switches, etc), servers, endpoints and appliances including security appliances need to be in focus. Also patches need to be tested for the internal use and then applied to the systems in focus within a reasonable time frame depending on the criticality of the issues being fixed.<br>
<!-- -->Components that are not longer supported by the vendor or an active community should not be used or only used with great care and additional and appropriate safeguards. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="endpoint-protection">Endpoint Protection<a class="hash-link" href="#endpoint-protection" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Endpoint protection is about blocking unauthorized changes to a system and to stop the execution of malicious code.<br>
<!-- -->This is normally done with (next-gen) anti-virus software that should always be kept up to date. For systems without support for such software application and execution whitelist could be used.<br>
<!-- -->Endpoint protection need to span on server and client systems and should be configured to alert in a centralized and immediate manner. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-segmentation">Network segmentation<a class="hash-link" href="#network-segmentation" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Network segmentation is about separating the network in multiple network zones that house systems of similar use. A very basic separation could be a three tier network architecture with Client-Zone, Server-Zone and DMZ for Server with external accessibility (internet).<br>
<!-- -->The aim of network segmentation is to limit, control and log the network traffic between the different network zones. When this is properly implemented it could be possible to limit the access from the Client-Zone to the Server-Zone to the necessary ports (Web, Mail, ERP...) and block all other access.<br>
<!-- -->The more granular and restrictive a network segmentation is built the better, but it also gets more troubling to manage. A good configuration management is key to achieve this.<br>
<!-- -->Network segmentation can for example be achieved with multiple firewall-interfaces, other means of VLAN or ACLs on managed switches. When creating a network segmentation the different network segments should be thoroughly planned and involve all available systems (including Virtual Machines and Networks). </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backup-strategy">Backup Strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#backup-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Once any malware has successfully rendered data or systems unusable the most common approach to recovery would be replaying the systems or information from a valid backup.<br>
<!-- -->The backup should follow some criteria to ensure usability in the case of an incident:</p><ul><li>Backups should be regularly and stored off-site or at least offline to ensure that they can&#x27;t be reached by a potential attacker that has infiltrated the network</li><li>Backup-Server should not be included in the domain and use dedicated accounts to hinder attackers that have acquired a valid domain admin account. </li><li>Backups should be done on a regular basis according to the criticality of the data to the business. For some data it may be required to only lose some minutes or hours in the event of data loss and for other information days or weeks may be fine. </li><li>Replaying backups should be tested from time to time to ensure that the process is working and that data can be restored within a reasonable time frame. </li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="restrict-administrative-accounts">Restrict Administrative Accounts<a class="hash-link" href="#restrict-administrative-accounts" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Before actually deploying ransomware attackers often try to scope and move through the infected network to increase the potential damage that could be done. For this domain-wide administrative accounts are a lucrative target.<br>
<!-- -->Make sure that all administrators have a low privileged user account for their daily tasks and only switch to their administrative account when absolutely necessary. Administrative accounts should also follow the least-privilege principle and domain administrators should be used even more limited. Another point to remember is to use dedicated accounts for services and not use administrative accounts when possible.Â Other means are <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft LAPS</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="security-appliances---firewalls--ids--mail-security">Security Appliances - Firewalls / IDS / Mail Security<a class="hash-link" href="#security-appliances---firewalls--ids--mail-security" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>The market offers a huge amount of security appliances for each and every need out there. To protect from ransomware the following are the most crucial:</p><ul><li>Firewall / IDS: Firewalls and IDS have the possibility to block communication to C&amp;C servers and potential downloads of Malware.Â </li><li>E-Mail Security: Mails including malicious attachments or links are a common tool for attackers. Make sure to have a proper configured spam filter in place and block incoming mails with executable attachments including office documents and content of archive files. Links within mails should be checked as well.Â </li><li>Managed Endpoint Protection: The endpoint protection solution should be central managed to have a unified view on alerts and the possibility to roll out measures to all devices simultaneously.Â </li><li>Web-Proxy: Implementing a web-proxy for all connections terminating outside the organizational network can help to monitor and restrict outgoing traffic. Furthermore, Malware which is not proxy-aware could be hindered. For servers internet connectivity should be monitored and restricted even more and a custom proxy could be used.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="endpoint-hardening">Endpoint Hardening<a class="hash-link" href="#endpoint-hardening" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Malware infections often start from one host and later spread through the network. Therefore, the protection of all endpoints is crucial. Make sure to limit access and available services to reduce the attack surface.</p><ul><li>Use endpoint hardening checklists offered by the CIS or other organizations to reduce the attack surface</li><li>Remove old and unpatched systems from the network</li><li>Disable SMBv1, Disable SNMP version 1 and 2, disable Windows script host, disable office macros or restrict them further if disabling is not an option</li><li>Restrict internet access where possible. Server should not have internet access in general. If they need to reach certain services only enable FW rules or access lists. Clients in general require internet access but mostly only for a few services/protocols (Mail, HTTP). Other services can often be restricted. (Like FTP, SSH, RPC...)</li><li>Also make sure to restrict communication within the domain. Not each workstation needs to reach everything in the domain and vice versa.</li><li>Disable USB storage if possible.</li><li>Enable Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applocker</a> or other whitelisting technology.</li><li>Enable Microsoft Defender <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/controlled-folders?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controller folder access</a>.</li><li>Enable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sysmon</a> logging.</li><li>Disable Windows Scripting Host (WSH).</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vulnerability-management">Vulnerability Management<a class="hash-link" href="#vulnerability-management" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Define and implement a mature vulnerability management process to constantly keep track of vulnerabilities in your network and remediate them accordingly. Known vendors are Tenable, Qualys etc.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="restrict-access-to-management-interfaces">Restrict access to Management Interfaces<a class="hash-link" href="#restrict-access-to-management-interfaces" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Management interfaces of all kind are prone to being abused by an attacker. Make sure to properly secure them (MFA) or disable external access all together.<br>
<!-- -->Common management interfaces exists for Web Apps, Network components like firewalls and switches and appliances as well as IoT devices.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awareness-trainings">Awareness Trainings<a class="hash-link" href="#awareness-trainings" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Uses are still the number one vulnerability in every infrastructure no matter the size. To tackle this make sure to not give them to many right and properly train your users to identify malicious activity and properly react and notify to it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vpn">VPN<a class="hash-link" href="#vpn" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>VPN when not properly secured offer an easy way for an attacker to infiltrate a network. Make sure to protect your VPN with current encryption methods, client-certificates and multi-factor authentication. Make as many services available through the VPN but not the internet to reduce your external perimeter. For Site2Site VPNs with third parties make sure that they only reach the needed targets and always configure with least privileges principle in mind.Â <br>
<!-- -->Also make sure to properly monitor and log authentication requests to find anomalies.Â </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="preparation-">Preparation <a name="prep"></a><a class="hash-link" href="#preparation-" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-orchestration-tools">Network orchestration tools<a class="hash-link" href="#network-orchestration-tools" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>When dealing with ransomware attacks it is helpful to have a hardware and software inventory as well as the possibility to roll out patches and software, make configuration changes and populate software to systems in the network. For example to schedule certain scans or patch for known vulnerabilities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ioc-scans-for-network-traffic-and-hosts">IoC scans for network traffic and hosts<a class="hash-link" href="#ioc-scans-for-network-traffic-and-hosts" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>During the analysis of ransomware certain indicators of compromise will be found. It is crucial to be able to scan the network traffic (netflow, IDS, Firewall) as well as the hosts (THOR, YARA) for these indicators in a central manner.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-segmentation-and-quarantine">Network segmentation and quarantine<a class="hash-link" href="#network-segmentation-and-quarantine" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>A strict network segmentation enables the possibility to isolate and quarantine certain systems and segments that seem to be infected without having to pull the plug.Â </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="central-log-management">Central Log management<a class="hash-link" href="#central-log-management" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>For analysis of incidents log data is key. Since attackers do know this as well they often seek to destroy or manipulate log data. A central, secured log service can help for later investigation of the incident, impact and attack methods used. Best utilized is a central log service when all log data is synchronized with a central timeserver and uses a common log format. Central log server should be properly secured to keep attackers at bay and store the data for some time in the past to enable thorough investigations (30 - 90 days considering priority).Â

Thus allowing to define certain characteristics that are often similar or even the same between different attacks using the same ransomware-software. This information can help through the whole response process. It is therefore crucial to identify the ransomware family. Besides information about the attack some ransomware families are known to have used weak encryption methods or faulty implementation thus allowing for decryption of the encrypted data.<br>
<!-- -->There are several ways to determine the ransomware type. In most events it is sufficient to read through the notes that are dropped by the attacker providing additional information about the attack on how to retrieve the data/make the payment. These notes are either placed in every folder/ the desktop/ opened by itself or visible as a changed background picture.
Another indicator may be the file ending of the encrypted files or the encrypted file itself (metadata etc...).<br>
<!-- -->Use normal search engines to identify the ransomware family with the above information or use specialized web services like <a href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NoMoreRansom</a> or <a href="https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ID-Ransomware</a> that will take an encrypted file and/or the ransomware note to automatically determine the ransomware type. In many cases this is sufficient.

When you have identified the ransomware family search for already conducted analysis reports and gather the following information:</p><ul><li>Decryption chances: Is it possible to decrypt the encrypted files without paying the ransom? What experiences have others made after paying the ransom? Are all files targeted? Is the whole file encrypted or only some information (may help with large files like databases which could be recovered if only the metadata was destroyed) ?</li><li>Indicators of compromise: What are common attack, persistence and lateral movement vectors used by the actors? Other indicators like network traffic to specific domains etc. . This information can be used to scan and locate and remediate the infection. Where are the executable dropped by the ransomware, are they still there? If so make sure to leave them in place for later analysis.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="determine-the-attack-vector">Determine the attack vector<a class="hash-link" href="#determine-the-attack-vector" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Try to track down the root of the initial infection through time-lining of infected systems or by statements from employees. Where this is not feasible try to track down the most potential targets and work from there. Common root causes can be:</p><ul><li>Phishing Mails: Mails with malicious links or files attached are one of the most common infection paths. These link often lead to faked pages that try to trick the user into downloading files or entering credentials that will then later be exploited. E.g. VPN Logins. With this you have to rely heavily on user feedback. Make sure to create a culture that supports employees to admin errors otherwise they will not call out to you in respect of the feared consequences.</li><li>Attached removable media: Untrained users may attach non-trusted media or devices to their company systems. This way unknown and untrusted software could be placed or executed on these systems.</li><li>Vulnerable systems: Unpatched, unmanaged or obsolete system pose a great threat and are often targeted by attackers. In focus lay system that are externally facing but this is not limited to them. Every vulnerable system can help the attackers to strengthen their foothold in the infrastructure. System that are often available to attackers and are prone to being exploited are for example VPN gateways, Firewalls, Mail server, Web- and application server, PBX systems, FTP server.</li><li>Unusual events in general: Make sure to also review all unusual events that occurred in the last several weeks or even months and check for possible connections. For example loss of hardware, burglaries, technology partners that were attacked or even employees that were terminated in bad standing can have a context to a malware outbreak way after.
The target is to identify the system where the attacker started to iterate the network and gather more information since this will most likely be a system infected very early and close to the attack vector itself if it is not the system posing the attack vector.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gather-information-about-the-malware-that-was-deployed-and-their-damage-potential">Gather information about the malware that was deployed and their damage potential<a class="hash-link" href="#gather-information-about-the-malware-that-was-deployed-and-their-damage-potential" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Try to get a sample from the active malware that was executed on the environment. Normally ransomware comes with various droppers, exploit kits, scanners and so on resulting in multiple binaries that we need to search for. Use the collected IoC from the ransomware family and search for executables in known locations. Other possibilities include reviewing last run software (prefetch, amcache/shimcache), system event logs, MFT timelines, auto start mechanisms (registry auto start keys, autostart folder, tasks, services, CRON jobs, bashrc etcâ€¦) and malware search tools like THOR, Rootkit Removal Tools, multiple antivirus suites to identify unknown malware binaries.<br>
<!-- -->Identified malware can be analysed through sandboxes or static analysis measure up to reverse engineering to find out what functionalities the malware had and what other damage may be done which is currently unknown.<br>

What system were infected for sure, what system may be infected and which system may be untouched. This has to be properly checked of course.<br>
<!-- -->Use automatic tools to scan the network for all identified IoCs. This can include checking for network traffic in central network components (firewalls, proxies, core switches). Other means are YARA or THOR rules or additional policies for the endpoint protection with the help of the vendor.<br>
<!-- -->Another important point is to identify affected data. This should focus on data that is damaged in the form of encryption but also data that may be copied without permission from the systems. When there is no DRM or Data Loss prevention in place this can be a very hard task to identify. Try to scope out the amount of outgoing traffic to known domains of the attackers and from which system it was sent. Starting with this search for manual executed commands or database queries. If you can&#x27;t further pivot the data that may be corrupted on a system you must assume the worst case. Identify stolen data is crucial since the attacker will try to threaten you with realizing stolen data. This is almost always a very hard task to do and depends heavily on the system to identify such actions in the first place.<br>
<!-- -->Also make sure to check for exposure/disclosure of PII since then you not only have to properly inform all affected persons and the data protection officers but also have to make sure what other measures were in place to secure PII and if they may be breached as well. (Encryption in rest etc.)<br>
<!-- -->Check whether backups were affected and how far the traces of the attack go to identify which backups may be safe.
