# DFIR Playbooks and Wiki

This repo will hold playbooks for common IT-Security related incidents and technical guidance for Forensic Analysis. It will be highly influenced by my job as incident responder. Feel free to share and add content as you go.

This repo will be published on the webpage [vault53.de](https://www.vault53.de) as [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) project. Every push and merge request to the master branch should trigger a redeployment.
