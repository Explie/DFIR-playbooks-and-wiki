Review your created documentation and conduct lessons learned sessions to improve the overall process of incident handling as well as overall IT security.

* **Review the incident response process:**
Enhance the response process for later incidents by collecting what went good and what not. Identify steps that needed more preparation and use the advice that was given by any involved parties throughout the response.

* **Discuss security enhancements:**
During the investigation of an incident many measures and potentials for enhancement will come to light. Keep track of them through the incident handling process and discuss them afterwards with deciders and colleagues to see which will fit your organization best and provide the most use for your overall IT-Security.

* **Conduct external reviews:**
To help further harden your infrastructure think about external review opportunities like penetration tests or security audits.

* **Determine Incident cost:**
